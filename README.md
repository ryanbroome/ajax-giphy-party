<h3>AJAX GIPHY PARTY</h3>
<ul>
<i>This exercise I was able to get through and only had to peak at the solution for getting the DOM elements to render on the page. I was running into a yellow error for cross origination error request or something like that. I didn't really use jQuery at all for this like the solution did. I will need some repition practice with this to get more comfy with it.
